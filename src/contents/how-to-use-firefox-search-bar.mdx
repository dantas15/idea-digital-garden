description: Tips and shortcuts to use Firefox search bar the way it's intended
---

Right now, Firefox is my favorite browser. It is definitely the fastest, but I feel like I'm more productive with Firefox because:

- The sync
  - It's simple: it just works perfectly and it's fast to manually sync
- The bookmarks
  - Firefox allows me to use tags on my bookmarks
    - It's great when using the search bar to find a specific bookmark, since my memory is not that good and I always search by a specific keyword
- The tabs
  - I always open a ton of tabs, so I need to be able to find them easily.

## Using the search bar

- As I've said, Firefox allows me to do all of this, but how am I productive with this?
- It's simple: I use my keyboard
  - When on the search bar, I can:
    - Add ^ to show only matches in your browsing history.
    - Add \* to show only matches in your bookmarks.
    - Add + to show only matches in bookmarks you've tagged.
    - Add % to show only matches in your currently open tabs.
    - Add # to show only matches where every search term is part of the title or part of a tag.
    - Add $ to show only matches where every search term is part of the web address (URL). The text “https://” or “http://” in the URL is ignored, but not “file:///”.
    - Add ? to show only search suggestions.
