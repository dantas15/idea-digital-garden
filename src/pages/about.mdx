## Me

My name is Gustavo, born and raised in Brazil. I'm currently studying Computer Science at the Federal University of Lavras.
I also work as freelancer software developer in my free time ðŸ˜….

I'm also interested in mental health, politics and philosophy.

### Note-taking

- I'm trying to make this my digital garden
- I currently use Notion for my personal notes, but I'll moving the most important ones here using the <a href={getActualHref("/zettelkasten")}>zettelkasten method</a>
- This is also an attempt to [learn in public](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public/)

## Studies

As I've said, I'm currently studying Computer Science. But I also went to a technical System Development course, which is where I fist learned how to code.
I really like to learn things by myself, like reading the docs and books that I find interesting.

## Professional experience

### Infoluck - Front-end developer

- I was able to connect their Back-end API with the frontend using react-query and zod, and manage it with React's ContextAPI.
- The main techs I worked with were:

    - [ContextAPI](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html)
  - [MantineUI](https://mantine.dev/)
  - [Zod](https://zod.dev/) for form values validation and API request/response validations
